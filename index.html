          Recent work has shown a shifting paradigm from Test Automation to Autonomous Software Testing (AUST). While Test Automation aims to automate the important tasks in a software testing process, Autonomous Software Testing aims to 
          make the process as full control, decision making, and operation by the machine.  That has been made possible due
          to the advances in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The purpose of this proposed workshop is to bring the researchers in both automated software engineering and AI/ML to advance autonomous software testing, which will, in the long term, lead to more effective solutions to software testing.
          In addition to attracting the community of researchers who usually
          attend ASE, we will make intensive efforts to attract researchers from the AI/ML and software testing industry to participate in the proposed workshop.

        <p>Software testing plays an important role to ensure the high quality of  a software product. Software testing validates if software is functioning appropriately and meeting requirements before it is released into production. 
        To improve the quality of software testing, several technologies have been introduced in an automated software testing (AST) process. For example, automatic test generation approaches [21, 22, 24] help improve the process of generating the test cases for the project under testing. Automated test optimization techniques [4, 9] could help developers in optimizing the current test suites with respect to different criteria and strategies.</p>  

        <p>The success of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has opened up several promising directions for advances in software testing.
        AI and ML have been contributing to making a transformative paradigm shift from Test Automation to Autonomous Software Testing (AUST). The idea of 
        AUST is similar in spirit to Vehicle Autonomy set forth by the Society of Automotive Engineers [6]. While testing is a creative activity, parts of it are repetitive and boring by nature — just like driving is.</p>

        <p>The repetitive daily commute could be a recipe for mistakes, so repetitive activities in testing could be overlooked and various serious defects could slip from us during our testing. Therefore, a natural question is whether AI/ML can help push software testing activities to become autonomous in a similar manner as the autonomous car driving. </p>

        <p>To transition to full autonomy in software testing requires a long process that involves the evolution of the hybrid and combination of humans and AI-powered systems that would enhance both human and machine capabilities.Eventually, autonomous software testing tools will be able to take control of test creation, maintenance, and execution processes. For example,  AUST will be able to learn from the performance of the previous test suites and make decisions on how the new test cases should be generated and prioritized to achieve the best future performance in revealing software bugs even when conditions change.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this proposed workshop is to bring the researchers in both automated software engineering and AI/ML to advance the autonomous software testing area. Recent work at several institutions by a growing group of researchers has shown that in fact, the advances in AI/ML have contributed significantly to improving various tasks that are crucial to AUST. Toward achieving full autonomy in software testing, as a community, we have accomplished several important components for AUST including automatic web testing with reinforcement learning [10, 24], automated mobile testing with image recognition [23], and flaky test prediction [1, 25].</p>

        <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-12">
        <p>This line of work requires skills in AI/ML, as well as knowledge and experience in software testing problems and approaches. Therefore, it is believed that there is an opportunity now to organize a workshop at the birth of this promising new area of research. The goal of this workshop will bring together software testing researchers who are venturing into this area, and also strive to attract some AI/ML researchers, drawing from strong research groups in universities and commercial research labs. One of the key sponsors of our workshop is Katalon, one of the leading companies building and operating test automation platforms, and we hope to draw organizational, technical, and logistical support from other software testing companies.</p>  

        <p>The area of AI/ML over the years has successfully developed a wide range of general models, methods, and algorithms that are highly efficient and effective for several application domains. Researchers in software testing have adapted and, in many cases, invented new techniques that leverage the state-of-the-art AI/ML models in producing important, fundamental components toward a full software testing autonomy. The maturity of both AI/ML and software testing has given birth to the successes of several AUST approaches in different phases of software testing including Test Planning [2, 16], Test Management, Test Maintenance [5, 13, 26], Test Generation [19, 21, 24], Test Selection and Optimization [3, 11, 12, 18].</p>

        <!--end table _1 -->

        <p>In the field of Automation Theory [7, 14, 15, 20], several models have been proposed to classify the interaction between human and machine ranging from a manual process to a fully autonomous one. Various automation theory models have different levels of automation. Table 1 shows the ten levels in the automation model proposed by Ensley and Kaber [7]. In general,
        all the models have two sets of levels. In the first set of levels (levels 1-5 in Table 1), the human plays the controlling role, while the machine does that in the second set (levels 6-10). If we consider all the tasks in software testing ranging from Test Planning to Test Evaluation and Report, we could define the different levels of automation for each task. One can map the existing approaches into each cell at each level for the tasks. Moreover, further opportunities for new directions and research topics can be identified, such as: </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Autonomous test generation with little or no human intervention,</li>
          <li>AI/ML for optimized test suites and test cases selection,</li>
          <li>AI/ML for prioritization of test cases and test configurations, </li>
          <li>Detecting and fixing flaky test cases and scripts,</li>
          <li>Autonomous test case repair and maintenance,</li>
          <li>Autonomous test suite evolution,</li>
          <li>Autonomous test script reuse.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Many of these tasks will require new types of models, new estimation techniques, and new computational approaches to exploit these models.</p>

        <p>There exists several attempts from the software industry to define autonomous testing models. For example, Gartner proposes five levels of autonomy ranging from Manual Testing (Level 0) and Assisted Testing (Level 1) to Intelligent Automated Testing (Level 4) and Autonomous Testing (Level 5) [8]. SmarBear describes six stages of test automation from manual to autonomous testing [17]. Such models are primarily useful for assessing at which levels test automation tools currently are and for providing directions for future tool offerings.</p>

        <p>We propose to organize a workshop to bring together researchers with relevant backgrounds. This workshop will include a keynote and then be organized into sessions that focus on specific topics.</p>

        <p>In this section, we present some of the animating ideas  that will drive the organization of the workshop. </p>

        <h3>Format</h3>
        <p>We propose a 1-day workshop that will be broken into sessions with regard to various research topics. We propose to begin with a brief one-hour keynote on the introduction and overview of autonomous software testing. We also plan to have another keynote from a software company on the current state of the practice in AUST.
        The remaining of the day will be primarily a series of sessions.</p>

        <p>The main sessions of the workshop will be organized around software testing problems where AI/ML methods have been applied or show a promising result. Each session starts with a few short presentations and ends with an open discussion. The precise topics and people are left to the organizing committee to decide, based on the submitted papers.</p>

        <h3>Selection Procedure</h3>
        <p>We will solicit the position and research papers, and then from these, we will select a smaller subset for presentation at the workshop. The remaining ones will be presented as posters during the workshop. The workshop paper submission deadline will be set accordingly to the deadlines of the main research track and workshops at ASE'22.</p>

        <p>Here is the names of potential program committee members:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Dr. Lingming Zhang, Univeristy of Illinois-Urbana Champaign</li>
        <li>Dr. David Lo, Singapore Management University</li>
        <li>Dr. Alex Orso, Georgia Tech University</li>
        <li>Dr. Lin Tan, Purdue University</li>
        <li>Dr. Shaohua Wang, New Jersey Institute of Technology</li>
        <li>Dr. Tien N. Nguyen, University of Texas at Dallas</li>
        <li>Dr. Vu Nguyen, University of Science, VNU-HCM   </li>       
        </ul>


        <h3>Publicity Plan and Follow-up Plan</h3>
        <p>We expect to receive from 30-40 submissions. Among them, we would accept about 20-30, and select 6-8 papers for presentations in 6-8 sessions. Each session begins with a presentation, followed by a panel of authors of related papers, and a discussion.</p>

        <p>The results and lessons learned from this workshop will be a good foundation for us to have a plan for a long-standing workshop series at ASE conferences in the future.</p>
